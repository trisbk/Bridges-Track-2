# Idea backlog — the agent's research memory

Statuses: OPEN (untested) · DEAD (tested, rejected, do not retry naively) ·
BANKED (in the current best recipe). Every DEAD entry links the run that
killed it in RESULTS.md — read the reason before proposing anything similar.

## Banked recipe (test primary 0.5986, day-1 close)
Listwise InfoNCE objective (K=4), mixed ensemble of 5× MLP (k=16, H=64,
lr 3e-4) + 5× FM (k=16, lr 1e-3), predictions z-scored per model before
averaging. Reproduce via experiments/ensemble.py.

## OPEN — ordered by expected value

1. ~~FwFM~~ DEAD (Run 9: 0.5978 = plain FM; interactions already balanced) — **FwFM (field-weighted FM)** — learn a scalar weight per field *pair*, so
   e.g. user×video interactions can matter more than tab×dur_bucket. Small
   param count, direct expressiveness gain over FM's uniform interactions.
2. BANKED (Run 10: 0.5984 single, best model; k=16/H=64 optimal per Run 12) — **MLP head over embeddings** — concat field embeddings → 1 hidden layer
   (e.g. 64, ReLU) → score. First nonlinear model in the series; needs its own
   lr search. Highest ceiling, highest variance risk.
3. DEAD (Run 13a: no gain; with Run 2, pointwise adds nothing in any mixture) — **Objective annealing** — start pointwise (fast, calibrated start), switch
   to listwise for late epochs. Cheap to test; small expected gain.
4. DEAD (Run 13b: −0.0101; top-scored negatives are near-positives, over-sampling them suppresses taste signal) — **Hard-negative curriculum** — sample negatives proportional to current
   model score (self-adversarial) rather than uniformly. Medium effort;
   interacts with InfoNCE's existing hard-negative weighting, may double-dip
   or may be redundant.
5. UNPARKED by owner 29 Aug night, IN FLIGHT (Run 18) — **Causal sequence features** — everything so
   far is static; use the user's strictly-prior behavior: last-impression
   label, rolling long_view rate over last 10, prior impression count, prior
   long_views with this author. Sorted by (date, time_ms); a row's features
   never include its own or any later label. The production-recsys #1 lever,
   untried here.
6. UNPARKED by owner 29 Aug night, QUEUED (Run 19) — **Multi-task auxiliary labels** — train log also records is_click /
   is_like / is_comment / is_hate; predict them jointly with shared embeddings
   (long_view stays the graded head). Better representations from data we
   already legally hold.
7. RETIRED UNUSED (legality analysis, 29 Aug night): every row of log_random_4_22_to_5_08 falls inside the valid/test window — training on it would be temporal leakage. — **Random-exposure log** — kit ships log_random (videos
   shown at random); a small unbiased sample usable for debiasing the
   algorithmically-biased main log.
8. DEAD (Run 16a: user×tab cross 0.5973, sparse cross overfits) — **Per-tab models or tab-conditioned interactions** — the log spans distinct
   surfaces (tabs); one global model may blur tab-specific taste. Check tab
   cardinality/skew first.
9. DEAD (Run 16b/c: τ=1 already optimal; sharpened and softened both worse) — **nDCG-targeted top-slot loss** — extra weight on getting the single best
   item right (nDCG@5's log-discount makes slot 1 worth most). Risk: fights
   GAUC half of the metric — mind the Run-1 lesson.

## DEAD — with the reason (do not retry the naive form)

- Row reweighting by 1/impressions (Run 1): GAUC is positive-count-weighted;
  helping nDCG's equal-user view hurts GAUC more.
- Dense play-ratio target (Run 1): duration-mediated → learns "prefer short
  videos". (Duration-normalised variant technically still open but
  low-priority.)
- BPR lr/pair-count scaling (Run 3): gain capped by objective, not hyperparams;
  lr ≥ .002 destructive.
- Embedding capacity k=32 (Run 4): does nothing under either objective.
- Categorical side features — hour/content/uactive/vpop (Runs 5–6): +0.0003
  noise-level, redundant with each other; do NOT stack.
- Explicit user×author / user×tag affinity rates (Runs 6–7): naive encoding
  self-leaks (−0.012); LOO-fixed version is redundant with FM factorization.
- Bigger K in InfoNCE (Run 4): K=8 ≈ K=4, saturated.
- Seed ensembling beyond 5 (Run 8): +0.0004 total; FM seeds converge to
  near-identical solutions. Already banked; more seeds won't add.
- Play-ratio as an AUXILIARY head over shared FM embeddings (Run 31): a dense
  graded engagement target, correlated 0.79 with long_view, still costs
  ~0.0011 validation whether it is duration-normalised or not and at either
  aux weight. Run 1 blamed duration mediation; Run 31 shows that was not the
  binding problem — the ratio is a *different ranking* of the same rows
  (watch-completion, not within-user preference), and any gradient that pulls
  the shared embeddings toward it pulls them off the GAUC/nDCG objective. Do
  not retry with a third normalisation.
- Side/content fields, re-tested under the FM-rich premise (Run 30): hour and
  video_type/music_type/tag are worth +0.0003 on validation under the FM on
  rich causal features — the *same* +0.0003 Run 5 measured under the MLP on
  base fields. Two model classes and two feature regimes apart, the number is
  unchanged: these fields carry ~no incremental ranking signal here, and the
  FM's pairwise factorization does not rescue them.

## Standing rules (from harness.py, enforced mechanically)

- ≥3 seeds; claim nothing under ±0.002 (noise σ≈0.0008).
- Verdicts on validation; test recorded for audit, never tuned on.
- Any per-entity rate feature over sparse keys → leave-one-out encoding
  (Run 6's lesson).
- Log intent BEFORE training (survives kills), result after.

## OPEN — residual unknowns for the autonomous agent's demonstration run

(Genuinely untested combinations; each earlier test was under different
premises, noted per item. The agent picks from these.)

10. DEAD (Run 30a: valid −0.00004 vs a same-run control; the premise change
    does not revive it) — **hour field under FM-rich** — Run 5 tested hour
    under the MLP on base fields only; never under the FM on rich fields.
11. DEAD (Run 30b: valid −0.00003 vs control; Run 30c stacking both = +0.00031,
    still 6× under the gate) — **content fields (video_type/music_type/tag)
    under FM-rich** — same premise gap as #10.
12. DEAD (Run 31: all three aux arms BELOW a same-run control on validation,
    −0.0011 to −0.0013; λ=0.3 and λ=1.0 alike, and the duration-normalised and
    duration-mediated targets are indistinguishable from each other) —
    **duration-normalised play-ratio as auxiliary signal** — Run 1 killed the
    naive ratio TARGET but explicitly left the duration-normalised variant
    open; never revisited after the objective/feature revolutions.
13. **K=2 under FM-rich** — K saturated upward (4≈8) on base fields; the
    cheap downward direction was never measured on rich fields.
14. **per-field embedding sizes** — video/user k=24, low-cardinality fields
    k=8; parameter budget shifted toward where cardinality lives. Never
    tested in any premise.
